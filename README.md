This is an exercise to learn more about HuggingFace Transformers and efficient fine-tuning using quantisation (QLora) and PEFT. The aim is to fine-tuning GPT-Neo-1.3B on a dataset of English poetry using Google Colab's free tier GPU. Below is a sample of poems output by the model when given the prompt, "I taste a liquor never brewed, " (I taste a liquor never brewed (214) - Emily Dickinson):

I taste a liquor never brewed,

I can't be tempted, but I feel

Some things I like, and others

I like but can't think of.

I taste a liquor never brewed,
And a liquor never drunk,
The one of the year gone by,
When I first met you, and drank your health.
Tomorrow you'll be as I am.
